                        <p class="card-text">One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861 a soldier lay in clump of laurel by the side of a road in western Virginia. He lay at full length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head upon the left forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle. But for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of the cartridge-box at the back of his belt, he might have been thought to be dead. He was asleep at his post of duty. But if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, death being the just and legal penalty of his crime...</p>

                        <p class="card-text">“The Ambitious Guest” begins in a moment of great tranquillity, with a family cozily gathered around their hearth. Father and mother, eldest daughter and aged grandmother, are briefly described as assuming the guises of persons of their ages who are filled with great contentment. Although they are entirely comfortable, mention is made of the harsh winter weather and the dangerous position of the cottage, over which towers a mountain. The noise of stones tumbling down the mountain has often startled the family at midnight.</p>

Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The art of Will Moses.The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was first published in 1820. At this point in Irving’s life he was a well known author for his writings and was becoming family famous. He drew connections with the story from German folklore from his heritage and from other people in his life. While the story was meant to be of a tale and for general amusement, it did have some historical influence into its writing. It was written after the war of 1812, the story tells of a man who’s superstition tends to get carried away and his own sins with greed get caught up into his troubles that eventually leads to his disappearance. In this time in history people had large fears of religion catching up with their sins and actions. Irving explores this with a whimsical tale of how our fears can get the best of us. Almost making fun of people and their over active imaginations.</p>
